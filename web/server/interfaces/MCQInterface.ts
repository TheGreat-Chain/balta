 * Interface representing the MCQTests document in mongoDB.

 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * To get started with Mongoose in TypeScript, we need to :
 *  1. Create an interface reprensenting a document in MongoDB
 *  2. Create a Schema correspondig to the document interface.
 *  3. Create a Model.
 *  4. Connext to MongoDB
 * 
 * In this directory we created the interfaces for documents in MongoDB.
